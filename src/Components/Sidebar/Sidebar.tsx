          the Highest Form of Human Culture. Among all the chaotic happenings of
          last week‚Äôs election, one particular incident might take the cake.
          Though not actually ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù (obviously due to embarrassment),
          Trump held a post-election press conference last week at Four Seasons
          Total Landscaping, a small and unspectacular local landscaping
          business in Philly rather than the famous luxury hotel by the same
          name, likely due to a booking mistake from his team. The
          super-memeable happening has been immortalized in VR Chat as a new
          spot for users to hang out in‚Ä¶which is nothing particularly notable
          except for how it has quickly become a gathering spot for online VR
          furries. Check out the desecration of Trump‚Äôs bootleg ‚ÄúFour Season‚Äôs‚Äù
          press conference, here.
